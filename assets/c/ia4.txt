Increasing ice caps also create a condition where there is less water vapor in the atmosphere. Because water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas, less of it means less heat is trapped. This contributes to the cooling of the Earth. This cycle continues, because as more ice is formed in the ice caps, less CO2 is being produced. Since CO2 is also a greenhouse gas, less CO2 also means less heat trapped, further cooling the Earth.
