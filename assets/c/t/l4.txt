When graupel collides with other water droplets or ice particles, it shears off the negative electrons from the particles that are moving into the top of the cloud through the updrafts, and the electrons collect on the descending particles, which settle in the bottom of the cloud. Since the electrons have been sheared off, leaving only a positive charge on the ascending particles, the cloud has a positively charged top and negatively charged base. These opposites create an electric field between the top and base which gets stronger the more the positives and negatives separate.
