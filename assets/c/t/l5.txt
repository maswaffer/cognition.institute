As the negative charge builds up at the bottom of the cloud, it forms a “stepped leader” which shoots to the ground in rapid steps, a process that occurs quickly and is not visible to the human eye. As it does this, a positive charge begins to grow on the ground and follows the storm. This positive charge reaches out to the negative charge above and is called a “streamer.” The positive energy begins to collect on the ground and any objects protruding up from the ground.
When these charged leaders get close enough to each other and electrical transfer occurs where the negative charge from the cloud reaches out to the positive charge on the ground. This creates a brilliant flash of bright light that we know as lightning.
