The Earth’s axis runs from the North Pole to the South Pole, but this axis is not actually stationary; it rotates like a wobbling top. Because it is “wobbly”, this rotation is called axial precession.  Every 26,000 years, axial precession completes a full cycle. However, the earth’s axis is tilted relative to the sun and is called an axial tilt. The axial tilt can vary between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees. Every 41,00 years this tilt completes a full cycle of going from 22.1 -24.5 degrees and back again.

In addition, and contrary to popular belief, the Earth’s orbit around the sun is not always exactly the same. Eccentricity, which is the shape of earth’s orbit around the sun, shifts from elliptical to circular and back again and this cycle happens about every 100,000 years.
