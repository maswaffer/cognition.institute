To measure this, the small amounts of energy released by the molecules upon realignment are measured with a coil, and computers are able to transform the captured signal into images that we can see in an fMRI. Computer transform the captured signal into the images we see on an fMRI. The image is “sliced” into squares (called voxels) that are between 1mm and 5mm wide. The final images are colored and are overlaid on a gray image of the brain so that activity can be located. When necessary, statistical corrections are made for different brain sizes. For instance, correction must be made for children since their brains are smaller than adults.
