Ice ages appear to happen on a cycle. When scientists look at ice core samples, they can see that for the past 1,000,000 years, ice ages have occurred on a 100,000 year frequency. Looking back further than 1,000,000 years ago, science shows that ice ages occurred every 41,000 years. While there can be many causes for this difference, scientists believe that possible reasons for this discrepancy are geologic events (volcanoes, major shifts in earth crust) or species bloom and extinction. Since humans are currently producing high levels of greenhouse gasses, the time until the next ice age may be different than what is generally predictable by science.
