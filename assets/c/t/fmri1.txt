One way to see what is happening inside our brains is to use a tool called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This is a device that uses magnetism and radio waves to build a 3D model of the brain. This includes different colors with areas of the brain that are active during a thinking exercise. It works by placing the patient or participantâ€™s head inside of a giant coil or tube for a period of time and capturing the images. The following paragraphs include a detailed explanation of how we can see brain activity using magnetism and radio waves.
