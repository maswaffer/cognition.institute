It is difficult for lightning to form without ice crystals forming and swirling in the very top of the thundercloud. Inside a thundercloud, there are often strong updrafts and downdrafts moving air and ice particles between 35,000 to 70,000 feet, with ice crystal collision causing static electricity. The downdrafts transport the frozen droplets in the form of hail or ice and into the lower region of the cloud where it is warmed. This process causes a releasing of heat in the frozen water droplets. As heat is released from the frozen water, it warms up the frozen droplets enough so that the surface of these droplets is warmer than everything else surrounding them; these droplets which are warm on the outside, but frozen on the middle are called “graupel.”
