Once inside the machine, a powerful magnet that is 3 Teslas (or 50,000 times the field of earth) is trained on the brain to begin to take imaging. Because of the charge of the magnet, the magnetic field causes the protons in the many different molecules of the brain to line up. This is an important step, because they are being lined up, just to be knocked over. 
The fMRI machine sends a burst of radio wave energy into the brain to knock over all of these positively charged protons. When the burst ends, the protons realign themselves with the magnetic field. When they do this realignment, they release energy that is measurable.
