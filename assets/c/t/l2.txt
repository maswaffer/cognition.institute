In order for a thundercloud to form and cause lightning, we need particular conditions to be in place. First, there needs to be high levels of moisture in the air combined with warmer temperatures on the ground. As the ground heats up, the air above the ground also heats causing the warm vapor to rise from the heated ground. Eventually, as the vapor rises higher into the sky, the atmosphere is cooler. At this point, condensation happens faster than evaporation, and a cloud forms and grows with more water vapor in the sky.
