Since the oxygenation happens about 2 seconds after activity as the brain “refills” and lasts only about 6 seconds, the signals can lag with real-time activity. This can make it difficult to determine with the actual brain activity occurs. However, fMRI uses block designs in which alternating activities are measured for 15-20 seconds at a time. For example, a participant may be asked to focus on pictures for 15 seconds, then have a 15 second rest, then focus on words for 15 seconds, then repeat a number of times. Because of the length in this structure of 15-20 seconds, it can show maximum differences between oxygenation and deoxygenation.
