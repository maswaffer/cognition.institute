To measure this, the small amounts of energy released by the molecules upon realignment are measured with a coil, and computers are able to transform the captured signal into images that we can see in an fMRI. These images are divided into squares called voxels that can range from 1mm to 5mm. The final images are colored and are overlaid on a gray image of the brain so that activity can be located. When necessary, statistical corrections are made for different brain sizes. For instance, correction must be made for children since their brains are smaller than adults.
