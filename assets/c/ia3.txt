All of these effects, axial precession, axial tilt and eccentricity, combine to cause sun’s rays to strike the earth at different angles. When there is a greater angle at the North and South pole, less heat is retained on Earth. When less heat is retained, ice caps can begin to build up. As more ice caps build, more of the sun’s rays bounce off into space. With the sun’s rays bouncing into space, instead of being retained on Earth, this is called the albedo effect and is an example of a feedback loop.
