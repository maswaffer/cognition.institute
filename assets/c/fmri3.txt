The amount of energy that the protons release depends on how fast they are able to realign. This gives off a signal called the “Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent” (BOLD) signal. It is named such because the cells of oxygenated blood realign faster that the cells of deoxygenated blood by approximately 20%. Since blood is more oxygenated in areas of brain activity, the active areas release more energy than inactive areas.
